# 🧙‍♂️ The Wizarding World of AI Agents Workshop 🤖

> *"Any sufficiently advanced AI is indistinguishable from magic."* - Arthur C. Clarke (if he were alive in 2025)

## 🪄 Welcome to Hogwarts School of AI Agentry and TypeScriptry!

Dear participants (or should I say, first-year students),

You've been accepted to the most prestigious program for learning the magical arts of AI Agent creation! Just as young wizards learn to channel their powers through wands, you'll learn to channel the power of Large Language Models through TypeScript. 

## 🎓 Workshop Overview

This workshop takes you from AI Muggle to Agent Wizard through a series of increasingly powerful enchantments (demos):

### 📚 Course Materials:

- **Demo 1: Basic Spells** - Like Harry's first year at Hogwarts, you'll start with the foundations of LangChain and prompt engineering. No need for Felix Felicis—your code will be lucky enough on its own!

- **Demo 2: Advanced Charms** - Dive into LangGraphJS workflows, where you'll create sophisticated agent interactions that would impress even Professor Flitwick.

- **Demo 3: Potions & UI** - Combine your magical AI agents with sleek interfaces in our Research Canvas example. Like brewing polyjuice potion, but with far fewer cat hairs.

- **Lab 2: Defense Against the Dark Arts** - Practice creating resilient LangGraph structures to defend against hallucinations and errors.

- **Lab 3: Magical Creatures** - Tame the powerful CopilotKit creature and learn to use its special abilities in your applications.

## 🧪 What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Create AI agents that are more helpful than Dobby and less chaotic than Peeves
- Master the three unforgivable bugs of AI development (hallucinations, prompt injection, and the dreaded undefined)
- Implement multi-agent systems that collaborate better than the Weasley twins
- Build intuitive interfaces for your magical creations
- Deploy your wizardry to the cloud, no owls required

## 🪶 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript (equivalent to having read "Magical JavaScript & Where to Find It")
- Node.js installed on your computer (your personal wand)
- API keys for various LLM providers (your spell components)
- A sense of humor (to deal with the occasional exploding cauldron)

## 🔮 Getting Started

Clone this repository (no summoning charms necessary), follow the setup instructions in each demo folder, and begin your magical journey!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coaching-ai-agents-workshop.git
cd coaching-ai-agents-workshop
# Install your magical dependencies
npm install
```

Remember: When debugging AI agents, it's LeviOsa, not LeviosA!

## 🧙‍♂️ Workshop Instructor

Your Defense Against the Dark Arts professor for this term is Ron, who has managed to survive teaching this subject for more than one year (a new record!).
